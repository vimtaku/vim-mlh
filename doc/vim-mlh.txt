CHANGELOG					*vim-mlh-changelog*

2011-12-31 many refactoring and change convert method.
 We have to type `/<Space>' for conversion.(before, we can only type `/' but it was changed.)
 The fix reason is for include slash string. (e.g. '/usr/bin/perlq/habennridesu.'
 But I think typing `/<Space>' is not annoying for us.

 Add for visual mode conversion.
 Visual mode conversion is convert method in visual mode.
 We can only use google transliterate convert on visual mode now(but I think it's enough.).

2011-12-24 bug fix.
2011-11-23 Initial commit.
